# Messages

## Telegram objects

TGPy is based on **Telethon**, a Telegram API client library. You can
use [Telethon objects and methods](https://docs.telethon.dev/en/stable/quick-references/objects-reference.html)
for messages, users and chats. This page explains how to perform basic message actions, such as sending and editing.

    Already familiar with Telethon?

    All you need to know is that in TGPy you can use the following objects:

    - `client` for the Telethon client
    - `msg` for the current message
    - `orig` for the message you’re replying to

    See the [Builtin reference](/reference/builtins/#telethon-objects) for details.

    Now you can skip the rest of the page and go to the [examples](/basics/examples) :)

In TGPy messages, you can always use some Telegram objects. The `client` object is helpful for general functionality,
such as sending messages, listing chats and so on. The `msg` object always refers to the current message.

## Sending a message

The simplest Telegram action is sending a message. There is a method for that:

```python
await client.send_message(chat, text)
```

<code>chat</code> can be either a chat name, a username, or an ID. For example, you can refer to the current chat 
with `msg.chat_id`. Hence, you can send a «Hello World» as following:

```python
await client.send_message(msg.chat_id, "Hello World")
```

Or use a shortcut for this exact action:

```python
await msg.respond("Hello World")
```

You can also use `msg.reply` instead of `msg.respond` to send the message as a reply, rather than just send it to the
chat.

!!! note

    The code above returns the new message. For now, TGPy shows the full info for the returned message, which may be 
    very long to display. You can add a `#!python return` to suppress it:

    ```python
    await msg.respond("Hello World")
    return
    ``` 

## Reusing messages

The new message object can be used later:

```python
hello = await msg.respond("Hello")  # (1)!
await hello.edit("Hiiiiiiiiii")
```

1. `hello` is now the new message object

You can use message properties such as `message.text`, `message.chat`, `message.sender` and others.

There are also message methods for common actions, such as `message.edit()`, `message.delete()`, `message.forward_to()`
, `message.pin()` and so on.

Have fun :)

??? example "Example: show full info about a message"

    ```python

    TGPy> Message(
     id=77305,
     peer_id=PeerChannel(
      channel_id=1544471292
     ),
     date=datetime.datetime(2021, 10, 31, 11, 20, 28, tzinfo=datetime.timezone.utc),
     message='return msg',
     out=True,
     mentioned=False,
     media_unread=False,
     silent=False,
     post=False,
     from_scheduled=False,
     legacy=False,
     edit_hide=False,
     pinned=False,
     from_id=PeerUser(
      user_id=254210206
     ),
     fwd_from=None,
     via_bot_id=None,
     reply_to=None,
     media=None,
     reply_markup=None,
     entities=[
     ],
     views=None,
     forwards=None,
     replies=MessageReplies(
      replies=0,
      replies_pts=87625,
      comments=False,
      recent_repliers=[
      ],
      channel_id=None,
      max_id=None,
      read_max_id=None
     ),
     edit_date=None,
     post_author=None,
     grouped_id=None,
     restriction_reason=[
     ],
     ttl_period=None
    )
    ```

## Getting the original message

The `orig` variable is a shortcut for the message you are replying to. 

For example, you can reply with this to get the uppercased text of the message:

```python
orig.text.upper()
```

When your message is not a reply, the `orig` object is None.
